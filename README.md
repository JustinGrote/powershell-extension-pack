You can also selectively disable extensions installed by the pack as you desire and enable them only for specific workspaces by first disabling them and then choosing Enable (Workspace) by right clicking the specific extension.

# Contributing
Pull request and extension issue suggestions welcome! I will considered however because this is opinionated I am the be-all-end-all as to what goes into the pack. I will always give you my best reason if I don't include something. Thanks!
